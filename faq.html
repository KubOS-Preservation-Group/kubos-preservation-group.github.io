<strong id="community-name">How did the name "KubOS Preservation Group" come about?</strong>
<p>
The name KubOS Preservation Group is inspired by <a href="https://www.fighttorepair.org/">Repair Preservation Group</a>, a nonprofit organisation that is creating resources and spreading a love for repair by creating community resources and events.

<p>
    Back in 2017, the then-CEO of KubOS did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxlu7Ow375E&t=3231s">an interview</a> where he talked about a cubesat <a href="https://eijournal.com/news/industry-insights-trends/spire-plans-constellation-of-private-weather-satellites">that he had been holding and working on</a>. A few months later,  a series of pictures of this very cubesat being launched. One of those very <a href="https://images.nasa.gov/details-iss038e003870">NASA pictures</a> is currently being used as the background image for this website.

<p>
    We are hoping to be able to post a full version of this story over on our <a href="/blog">blog</a> in the future.
